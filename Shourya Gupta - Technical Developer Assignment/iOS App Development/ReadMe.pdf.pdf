- Displays a list of products with images.
- Uses SwiftUI and MVVM architecture.
- Allows users to navigate to a detailed view for each product.
- Fetches data from a JSON file stored in the app bundle.

## Project Structure

  - **Product.swift**: Defines the Product model.
  - **ProductViewModel.swift**: Handles fetching and decoding product data.
  - **ContentView.swift**: Displays the list of products and navigates to details.
  - **ProductDetailView.swift**: Shows details of a selected product.
